# dorkbash
A zork-like game written only in bash.

### Disclaimer
This game is written in shell code, which is a terrible idea for a game. You could hide a lot of malicious things in here if you got someone else to run it. 
I promise there are no secret sudo commands, no system-related operations, just calls to other game shell files, but it's still a terrible idea, so touch at your own risk.

### Why?
I don't know, I felt like I should 'practice' some shell code, and a zork-like game was the only thing I felt like doing. 
Turns out bash can do some funny things with arrays and whatnot if you really want to.
